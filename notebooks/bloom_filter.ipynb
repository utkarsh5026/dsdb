    "# The Mathematics of Bloom Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "Bloom filters are probabilistic data structures that efficiently represent sets and support membership queries. Understanding the mathematics behind Bloom filters is crucial for optimizing their performance and understanding their behavior. This document explores the key mathematical concepts and formulas underlying Bloom filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Basic Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A Bloom filter consists of:\n",
    "- A bit array of m bits, initially all set to 0\n",
    "- k different hash functions, each mapping an element to one of the m array positions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "When an element is inserted:\n",
    "- It is hashed by each of the k hash functions\n",
    "- The bits at the resulting k positions are set to 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Querying\n",
    "\n",
    "To query for an element:\n",
    "- It is hashed by each of the k hash functions\n",
    "- If all the bits at the resulting k positions are 1, the element is considered \"possibly in the set\"\n",
    "- If any of the bits are 0, the element is \"definitely not in the set\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. False Positive Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of a false positive (p) after inserting n elements is approximately:\n",
    "\n",
    "p ≈ (1 - e^(-kn/m))^k\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- m is the size of the bit array\n",
    "- n is the number of inserted elements\n",
    "- k is the number of hash functions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Optimal Number of Hash Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal number of hash functions (k) that minimizes the false positive probability is:\n",
    "\n",
    "k = (m/n) * ln(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be derived by differentiating the false positive probability formula with respect to k and setting it to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Optimal Size of the Bit Array\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a desired false positive probability p and the number of elements n, the optimal size of the bit array m is:\n",
    "\n",
    "m = -(n * ln(p)) / (ln(2))^2\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Capacity and Fill Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "The fill ratio of a Bloom filter is the proportion of bits set to 1. It can be approximated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "fill_ratio ≈ 1 - e^(-kn/m)\n",
    "\n",
    "As the fill ratio approaches 1, the false positive rate increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Estimating the Number of Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a Bloom filter with m bits, k hash functions, and x bits set to 1, we can estimate the number of elements n as:\n",
    "\n",
    "n ≈ -(m/k) * ln(1 - x/m)\n"

    "## Counting Bloom Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "A Counting Bloom Filter (CBF) is an extension of the standard Bloom Filter that allows for the removal of elements. It achieves this by using an array of counters instead of a simple bit array. Each counter keeps track of the number of times a particular position has been set, enabling both addition and deletion of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components:\n",
    "1. **Count Array**:\n",
    "   - An array of integers (counters) initialized to all zeros. Each counter represents the number of times a particular bit position has been set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hash Functions**:\n",
    "   - Multiple independent hash functions that map elements to positions in the count array. Each hash function should uniformly distribute the input elements across the count array.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Operations:\n",
    "1. **Add Operation**:\n",
    "   - To add an element, each hash function is applied to the element to get multiple hash values. The corresponding positions in the count array are incremented by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Remove Operation**:\n",
    "   - To remove an element, each hash function is applied to the element to get multiple hash values. The corresponding positions in the count array are decremented by 1, ensuring the count does not go below zero.\n",

    "### Compressed Bloom Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "A Compressed Bloom Filter (CBF) is a variant of the standard Bloom Filter designed to reduce the space required to store the filter. This is particularly useful in scenarios where memory is limited or when the Bloom Filter needs to be transmitted over a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts:\n",
    "1. **Compression**:\n",
    "   - The bit array of the Bloom Filter is compressed using standard compression techniques (e.g., run-length encoding, Huffman coding, etc.) to reduce its size.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Decompression**:\n",
    "   - When an element needs to be added or checked, the compressed bit array is decompressed, the operation is performed, and then the bit array is recompressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Space Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - By compressing the bit array, the Compressed Bloom Filter achieves better space efficiency compared to a standard Bloom Filter, at the cost of additional computational overhead for compression and decompression.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Operations:\n",
    "1. **Add Operation**:\n",
    "   - Decompress the bit array.\n",
    "   - Apply the hash functions to the element to get multiple hash values.\n",
    "   - Set the corresponding positions in the bit array to 1.\n",
    "   - Recompress the bit array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check Operation**:\n",
    "   - Decompress the bit array.\n",
    "   - Apply the hash functions to the element to get multiple hash values.\n",
    "   - Check if all the corresponding positions in the bit array are set to 1.\n",
    "   - Recompress the bit array.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compression and Decompression**:\n",
    "   - Use efficient compression algorithms to minimize the size of the bit array while maintaining the ability to quickly decompress and perform operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "- **Reduced Memory Usage**: The primary advantage of a Compressed Bloom Filter is its reduced memory footprint, making it suitable for memory-constrained environments.\n",
    "- **Network Efficiency**: Compressed Bloom Filters are more efficient to transmit over a network due to their smaller size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages:\n",
    "- **Computational Overhead**: The need to compress and decompress the bit array for each operation introduces additional computational overhead.\n",
    "- **Latency**: The time taken for compression and decompression can increase the latency of add and check operations."
